        The formation of the group grew out of a meeting Gandalf had with Thorin in Bree which kindled Thorin's interest
        in recapturing his long lost family inheritance. (Thorin's grandfather had been the King under the Mountain when
        Smaug came and took it.) Remembering that he had once known an adventurous Hobbit on his travels in the Shire,
        Gandalf decided to add Bilbo to their company because he knew that stealth and cunning were preferable to force.
        Gandalf also believed that someone like Bilbo could keep the sometimes prideful and stubborn Dwarves from rash
        action. The superstitious Dwarves also considered thirteen to be an unlucky number, and as Gandalf had planned
        to leave on other business, welcomed a fourteenth to fill into their party.

            <h3>Thoren Okenshield</h3>
            <p> Thorin II was born in TA 2746 to Dwarf prince Thráin II in the city of the Lonely Mountain. Early in his
                youth, he and the other Dwarves of the Lonely Mountain were forced to flee by the dragon Smaug in TA
                2770. While in exile, he quickly grew to become a capable warrior. This was demonstrated when he
                participated in the Battle of Azanulbizar in TA 2799. He fought with one of the Dwarven armies beneath
                the East-gate of Moria. At some point in the fighting, his shield broke, and using an oaken tree branch
                found on the ground as a shield, he gained the epithet "Oakenshield," which would remain with him even
                in death.[2]

                Thorin became King-in-Exile of Durin's Folk in TA 2850 after his father went missing, and died in the
                dungeons of Dol Guldur.</p>

<h3> Fili and Kili</h3>
<p>Fíli and Kíli were nephews of Thorin, who was the elder brother of their mother Dís. They were also nephews of
    Frerin, grandsons of Thráin II, and great-grandsons of Thrór. Fíli's most distinguishing feature was his long nose,
    the longest of any of the Dwarves in Thorin's company.[2]
    As the youngest Dwarves, Fíli and Kíli had the sharpest eyes, and were often sent scouting or searching. It was they
    that found the Front Porch while in the Misty Mountains.[3]
    With the other Dwarves, Fíli and Kíli encountered spiders and were later imprisoned by the Elvenking Thranduil.[4]
    They escaped the cells thanks to Bilbo, traveling down the river in barrels until they reached Lake-town.[5] The
    brothers accompanied Thorin and Bilbo to Lake-town while the others rested by the river.[6]
    At the feet of the Lonely Mountain, Fíli and Kíli scouted Ravenhill and found the Front Gate with Balin and Bilbo.
    Also, with Bilbo, they found the side-door leading into the mountain.[7]
    Both brothers were killed while defending the mortally wounded Thorin Oakenshield in the Battle of Five Armies, and
    all three were buried with honor.</p>

            <h3>Óin</h3>
            <p> Óin was the older brother of Glóin, cousin of Dwalin and Balin, and uncle of Gimli. Óin's uncle was
                Fundin, the father of Balin and Dwalin. He usually wore a brown-hooded cloak when travelling. Óin fought
                in the Battle of Azanulbizar along with Thorin Oakenshield, and in TA 2941 joined with Thorin and
                Company on the quest to reclaim the Lonely Mountain wearing a brown hood.[2] Óin was one of the Dwarves
                who bet that Bilbo would come along with them to reclaim the Lonely Mountain. Óin and his brother Glóin
                were usually in charge of preparing the fire for the Company as they were the most skilled out of the
                others. He fought in and survived the Battle of Five Armies, and later settled in the Lonely Mountain
                with King Dáin II Ironfoot, along with many other Dwarves of The Company of Thorin.</p>
